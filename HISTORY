Corvid version history

Version 0.3 - March 12, 2020

Corvid is based on FluTE (https://github.com/dlchao/FluTE).

Several parameters were adjusted to adapt the FluTE flu transmission 
to Corvid coronavirus transmission, such as incubation period,
symptomatic fraction, and viral load trajectories.
The parallel computing version was removed, so populations of more than
10,000,000 will probably not run on a laptop.

Version 0.1 or 0.2 added a "work from home" policy.
Version 0.3 is the first version the outside world has seen.
Version 0.4 fixes bug in "liberal leave" that made it happen before the policy was supposed to start and a huge bug in incubation time.
Version 0.5 adds option for home isolation after ascertainment, community contact reduction, and work policies of limited duration. Also many bug fixes. This version was used for the medRxiv manuscript "Modeling layered non-pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-CoV-2 in the United States with Corvid".
Version 0.6 fixes bugs in transmission during quarantine (bug found by Freddie Bartlett-Evans in FluTE) and in withdraw probabilities (bug found by Greg Anglin).
